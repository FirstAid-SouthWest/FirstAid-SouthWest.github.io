	<p>This qualification is for people who have a specific responsibility at
	work, or in voluntary and community activities, to care for and provide
	first-aid to those with epilepsy.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="column-section">
	<h2>Entry requirements</h2>
	<p>All learners must have received the initial induction course (Positive
	Handling and Conflict Management).</p>
	<p>The learner must be able to participate throughout the day. It is the
	responsibility of the client to assess all participants to ensure that they
	are fit to participate in training and confirm this to the trainer. Any
	health issues or concerns should be investigated prior to the course and a
	fit to work certificate issued by occupational health or the client&#39;s
	general practitioner.</p>
	<p>There are three methods of assessment, to ensure that learners have
	gained the required knowledge, skills and understanding relating to
	epilepsy:</p>
	<p><b>Formative assessments: </b>a range of informal assessment
	procedures.</p>
	<p><b>Practical assessment: </b>this is observed by the Trainer throughout
	the course .</p>
