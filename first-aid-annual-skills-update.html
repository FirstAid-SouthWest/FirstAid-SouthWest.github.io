	<h2>Aim of the Qualification</h2>
	<p>The aim of the qualification is to enable learners to refresh the 
	knowledge and competencies needed to deal with a range of emergency first 
	aid situations. Learners should be able to demonstrate the practical 
	administration of safe, prompt, effective first aid in emergency situations 
	with an understanding of the role of the first aider.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="column-section">
	<h2>Intended Audience</h2>
	<p>The qualification is designed for qualified first aiders who have a 
	specific responsibility at work, or in voluntary and community activities, 
	to provide First Aid when dealing with an emergency situation, who need to 
	refresh their skills as recommended by the HSE and to avoid skills fading.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="column-section">
	<h2>Requalification Requirements</h2>
	<p>The Annual Refresher is only valid for a period of 
	1 year. At which point the learner would normally retake this qualification 
	or repeat their FAW or EFAW qualification. This is in line with the 
	requirements of the Health and Safety (First-Aid) Regulations 1981.</p>
