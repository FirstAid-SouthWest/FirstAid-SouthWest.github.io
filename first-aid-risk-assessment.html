<h1>First Aid Risk Assessment</h1>
<div class="two-column-container">
	<p>The employer must carry out an assessment of needs. This will result in 
	identifying the degree of hazard, additional factors that could influence 
	your overall first-aid provision and number of employees in your workplace. 
	The results will also suggest the number and type of first-aid personnel 
	that should be present at all times people are at work.</p>
    
	<h2>In assessing their needs, employers should consider:</h2>
		<p>&bull; the nature of the work and workplace hazards and risks;<br>
		&bull; the nature of the workforce;<br>
		&bull; the organisation's history of accidents;<br>
		&bull; the size of the organisation;<br>
		&bull; the needs of travelling, remote and lone workers;<br>
		&bull; work patterns;<br>
		&bull; the distribution of the workforce;<br>
		&bull; the remoteness of the site from emergency medical services;<br>
		&bull; employees working on shared or multi-occupied sites;<br>
		&bull; annual leave and other absences of first-aiders and appointed persons;<br>
		&bull; first-aid provision for non-employees.</p>

	<p>The employer must inform his employees of the arrangements that have been 
	made in connection with the provision of first-aid, including the location of 
	equipment, facilities and personnel.</p>
