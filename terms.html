<h2 align="center"><u>Terms and Conditions</u></h2>

            <br>

            <p><mark>Important notice: Please read carefully before buying any training course(s)</mark></p>

            <h4>Cancellations</h4>
            <p>The following conditions apply:</p>

                <p style="padding-left:2em">&bull; In the event of a cancellation by the customer, a cancellation fee will apply. Where less than 14 days notice is given this will be the full invoice amount. </p>
                <p style="padding-left:2em">&bull; Where more than 14 days notice is given cancellation fee of &pound;150 will apply. Subsequent training days will then be charged at the prevailing rate.</p>
                <p style="padding-left:2em">&bull; Any travel costs and or venue fees incurred due to the cancellation will be charged to the client.</p>

            <h4>Open Courses</h4>

                <p style="padding-left:2em">&bull; Delegates may transfer their registration for one course to another course up to 21 working days prior to the original course date. Once a delegate has transferred no refunds can be made for the cancellation of either course.</p>
                <p style="padding-left:2em">&bull; FirstAid-SouthWest and Training reserve the right to cancel a course at any time without incurring any additional liability to the client or any delegate.  In such circumstances, we will offer alternative dates, a full refund or credit note.</p>
                <p style="padding-left:2em">&bull; If a place has been reserved on an open course full payment should be made before the commencement of the course.  </p>
                <p style="padding-left:2em">&bull; All cancellations must be made no later than 14 working days before the start of relevant Training Course. We will only accept cancellations that are made in writing. If a delegate fails to attend a Training Course, or a cancellation is sought within the 25 working days prior to the start of such course, full payment will be required.</p>
                <p style="padding-left:2em">&bull; Course fees are to be paid no later than 14 days of your course booking.</p>


            <h4>Payments</h4>
            <p>Please pay by BACS:</p>

                <p style="padding-left:2em">&bull; BACS: Sort Code: 309037 Acc no. 36704068 FirstAid-SouthWest and Training</p>
                <p style="padding-left:2em">&bull; QUOTING your invoice number - found at the top right of your invoice.</p>


            <h4>Courses held on customer&#39;s premises</h4>

                <p style="padding-left:2em">&bull; Cancellation fees will still be applicable regardless of the training venue and regardless of the number of staff attending the course.</p>
                <p style="padding-left:2em">&bull; Facilities that have been agreed prior to the course booking must be available half an hour before the commencement of the course to allow the course tutor to set up.  Parking near the building should where possible be reserved for the course tutor to reduce the distance travel carrying equipment. </p>
                <p style="padding-left:2em">&bull; You must inform us in advance of any access problems or threats to the security of well-being of our training tutors. You must also ensure that there is adequate insurance in place for our training tutors whilst on your premises.</p>
                <p style="padding-left:2em">&bull; It is the customer&#39;s responsibility to ensure that they have enough people to attend the course (up to a maximum of 12 per session unless agreed otherwise in advance) and that there is sufficient space for the course to be carried out.</p>


            <h4>Health Considerations</h4>

                <p style="padding-left:2em">&bull; Some of our courses can be very physical and demanding. It is the employer&#39;s responsibility to ensure that candidates placed on our courses (whichever course that may be) are free from any conditions or illnesses that could affect their ability to carry out activities of the course.</p>
                <p style="padding-left:2em">&bull; Any candidate attending a FirstAid-SouthWest & Training course that has any illness, disability or injury that may become aggravated due to the intensity of our courses must inform the trainer prior to commencement of the course. Any injury or illness caused as a result of our training courses must be reported to the training tutor on the day of the course, either at the time or at the end of the course. In this regard we will reserve the right to refuse any individual with any such illness, disability or injury to attend the course if the training tutor deems it unsafe for them to do so.</p>


            <h4>Paperwork</h4>
            <p>To reduce our carbon foot print:</p>

                <p style="padding-left:2em">&bull; FirstAid-SouthWest and Training are now issuing E-certificates, unless requested otherwise.  </p>
                <p style="padding-left:2em">&bull; We will not issue handouts during the course.  Course details can be emailed upon request following the course.</p>
                <p style="padding-left:2em">&bull; Invoices are sent electronically.</p>
